This is a repository of films for Marathon, Marathon 2, Marathon Infinity, and various third-party scenarios, primarily adhering to the [Vidmaster’s Challenge](https://marathon.bungie.org/vidmaster/). I have uploaded many of these to [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/MarathonVidmaster/), but if you have the correct scenario, you can view these yourself in Aleph One with whatever settings you want by putting these in your [Recordings directory](https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/wiki/File-Locations#saved-games--films--screenshots--saved-levels) and going to “View Saved Film”.
